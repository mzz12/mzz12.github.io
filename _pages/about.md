Hi, My name is Zizhao Mo (èŽ«æ¢“é’Š). I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Macau, where I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/huanlexu/">Prof. Huanle Xu</a> at <a href="https://cds-macau.github.io/">Cloud and Distributed Systems Lab</a>. 

My research interest boardly revolves around the machine learning systems (MLSys), focusing on the scheduling, parallelization optimization, and resource management topics. I also have specific interest in designing efficient systems over heterogeneous resources, including CPU-GPU and heterogeneous GPUs platforms. 

I am currently on job market and welcome opportunities from both academia and industry. Please feel free to contact me!
